# Welcome to Web Winter Project

## Task 1
### Part-1: Recreate the Given Page.

Hey guys, welcome to **Task - 1**. For this task, you have to _recreate_ the given Web Page using HTML and then proceed to styling it with CSS. 

**HTML** stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. It's essentially the language in which most websites are written. 

HTML consists of tags and attributes. Look up what they are, also look up what are inline and block elements in HTML. It's important that you understand the difference between `div` and a `span` tag. 

For this part of the task,

Create a sub directory task_1 in your web-winter-2019 directory by:

       mkdir task_1   
       cd task_1  
             
In this directory, place your html file.

#### IMPORTANT

Guys, we want you all to update whatever you've learnt on the **README.md** file so that your mentors can keep track of your progress. You can also update resources you've found online that helped you a lot or issues that you faced while doing the tasks. This will help you in the long run as you won't tend to repeat your mistakes.

### Part-2: Styling the Page

For this part, we'll be looking into **CSS**. Cascading Style Sheet is used to make web pages _attractive_. **Make a copy of your previous HTML file and create a CSS file to attach to it.** Style the easier components first then move onto the harder ones. 

Get familiar with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), look into **image styling** and _beware_ of **line styling** and why look up why you shouldn't use it. Include social icons on the page which redirect you to respective social websites. Try looking into various backgrounds for the web page.

## Task 2


Hey guys, we will now start off with **Task - 2**. We recommend that you start this task only **after you finish task 1**.

For this task, you have to _recreate_ the given Web Page using HTML as well as CSS and learn how to use media queries in order to make the given webpage mobile compatible.

**The JPEG format of the images of the website that you will be recreating are on the master branch, in the directory called Task-2.**


For this task, we want you guys to focus on a few CSS Layout Models:
* Flex Box
* CSS Grid

Try flex box for a framework and use media queries to make it responsive.

For this part of the task,

Create a sub directory task_2 in your web-winter-2019 directory by:

       mkdir task_2   
       cd task_2 
             
In this directory, place your html as well as your CSS files.

#### Important

- Some concepts to check out during this task:
        - Font Size
        - View/height/width
- Understand the conceptual differences between: `em`,`rem`,`px`&`%`. 

- To check whether your media queries are completely functional or not, you should learn how to use the **Chrome Developer Tools** to the fullest. Refer to the following video for the same.

## Task-3

 For this task you have to design a **Form** using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You have to validate the form and display the input details once the form is submitted.

JavaScript is a very powerful client-side scripting language. It is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage.
For this part of the task,

Create a subdirectory task_3 in your web-winter-2019 directory by:
```
       mkdir task_3  
       cd task_3
```
             
Place all your files in this directory.

Your folder should have:
* ```index.html```  - The core HTML
* ```style.css``` - Stylesheet
* ```script.js``` - JavaScript file.

#### Guidelines for the Form:
* Elements to be taken as input:
  1. Name
  2. Username (Should contain a digit)
  3. Email (Look up **JS regex expression** for email validation)
  4. Phone Number (10 digits)
  5. Password and Confirm Password (Input type should be password, minimum length of 8, should contain at least one digit and uppercase/lowercase alphabets)
  6. An "I agree to the terms and conditions" checkbox.

* If any input is incorrect, mark the particular element in red, and display an error message below the input field.
* Display all the input in a separate space below after submitting.
* Try Making it responsive
* Make it look pretty.
