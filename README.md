For this task, you have to recreate [the given Web Page](https://github.com/swadhinroutray/winter-web-resources/blob/master/Task1/HTML.jpg) using HTML and then proceed to styling it with CSS. 

**HTML** stands for **Hyper Text Markup Language**. It's essentially the language in which most websites are written.

## Part-2: Styling the Page

For this part, we'll be looking into **CSS**. Cascading Style Sheets are used to make web pages attractive. Create a new CSS file, and link it to your HTML. Style the easier components first then move onto the harder ones. Recreate the following [web page](https://github.com/swadhinroutray/winter-web-resources/blob/master/Task1/HTMLwithCSS.jpg)

Get familiar with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), look into image styling and beware of line styling and why look up why you shouldn't use it. Include social icons on the page which redirect you to respective social websites. Try looking into various backgrounds for the web page.

# Task-3

 For this task you have to design a [Form](https://github.com/swadhinroutray/winter-web-resources/blob/master/Task3/FormExample.mp4) using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You have to validate the form and display the input details once the form is submitted.

For this part of the task,

Youâ€™ll be working with these three files:
* ```index.html```  - The core HTML
* ```style.css``` - Stylesheet
* ```script.js``` - JavaScript file.

### Guidelines for the Form:
* Elements to be taken as input:
  1. Name
  2. Username (Should contain a digit)
  3. Email (Look up **JS regex expression** for email validation)
  4. Phone Number (10 digits)
  5. Password and Confirm Password (Input type should be password, minimum length of 8, should contain at least one digit and uppercase/lowercase alphabets)
  6. An "I agree to the terms and conditions" checkbox.

* If any input is incorrect, mark the particular element in red, and display an error message below the input field.
* Display all the input in a separate space below after submitting.
* Try Making it responsive
* Make it look pretty.
